## Transition

### App Description
An android application for closeted LGBTQ+ members to anonymously post their questions/concerns and helping them transition into accepting themselves. We wanted to create a wholesome environment for people to gain a deeper understanding of their gender identities and sexual orientation. The app is an anonymous, non-judgmental forum. It was created as a safe place for the LGBTQ+ individuals.
